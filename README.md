# Scraddle
A simple Anagram solver, and scrabble/generic scorer with multiple players


My wife and I spend a lot of time playing board games, especially scrabble,
I can never find a blank piece of paper when I need it, so decided to create this.

Also watching 8 out of 10 cats do countdown, gave me the inspiration to try make an anagram solver.
